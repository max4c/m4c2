I enjoy tools that are pieces of art in and of themselves. This page is inspired by Kevin Kelly's [CoolTools](https://kk.org/cooltools/) site. Below is a continually updated list of tools I use in my personal and professional life that spark joy.

#### Everyday Productivity

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) - I use it ~100 times a day for so many things. It is the foundation of my efficiency on macOS.
- [Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats) - See cpu, gpu, ram in the menu bar in real time.
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc) - Can't copy text with your cursor? Use this to scan the text.
- [Linear Mouse](https://linearmouse.app) - Increase cursor movement than highest speed on Macos. My pointer speed is 0.13, do not go to the max speed as it will be extremely hard to reset it
- [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.so/product/calendar) - Good design. I preferred when it was named Cron.
- [Dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer) - Hide apps in the menu bar. I thought about building this for so long and then ended up finding it!
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - Password autofill is so satifying. Simple and it just works.

#### Developer Tools

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) - I prefer this over Github copilot + VS Code. It's essentially the same layout/design as VS Code with very intentional AI features
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) - Makes the terminal experience on macos smooth.
- [Disk Inventory X](http://www.derlien.com) - best way to visually manage storage on macos.

### Ergonomics and Focus 
- Binaural beats for focus and relaxation especially when coding
- ZSA [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander)
- Logitech [Lift Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-mac.910-006471.html)
- [Roost laptop stand](https://www.therooststand.com)

#### Sites

- [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) - best answer engine out there. Also when I met Aravind, the CEO, at AI grant, he was quite nice and softspoken.
- [Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) - if perplexity doesn't have it, I go here. I love being able to watch videos here instead of getting sucked into wasting time on youtube.
- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net) - anytime I need a software tool I go here.
- [Packhacker](https://packhacker.com) - Really great site to find travel gear.
- [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) - Best well-designed typing practice site.
- [Catalog Choice](https://www.catalogchoice.org) - Want to stop junk mail coming to your house? Here's how

#### Notetaking

- [Notion](https://notion.so) - My LifeOS. Also my todo list and personal project management tool. For team project management, I prefer Linear.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - Local notetaking that makes a beautiful writing experience.
- [Pilot G-2 05](https://www.amazon.com/PILOT-G2-Pens-Refillable-Retractable/dp/B09GKY4QT1) - I handwrite in my journal nightly and this pen makes it so satifying.

#### Clothing

- [Ibex](https://ibex.com) - Sustainable lululemon that aligns with my interest in hiking and plastic-free clothing.

#### Health

- [Flux](https://justgetflux.com) - Turns off the blue light on a laptop in order to not interfere with sleep.
- [Earthrunners](https://www.earthrunners.com) - I have used these for about 85% of all of my walking for 2.5 years. Start very cautiously, especially if you want to run in them.
- [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak) - I never learned to touchtype until college when my wrists started to hurt a lot due to ignorance concerning propr ergonomics. I chose colemak as my keyboard layout and enjoy it so much. Instead of looking at a diagram of where letters are, I just started completely fresh on monkeytype and looked at the screen and let muscle memory develop over time. After 2 years, I am floating around 84 wpm with 96% accuracy
