title: Compound Growth in Everything?

Compound interest is defined by wikipedia as:

interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest.
The formula for compound interest is as follows:

<LatexEquation block equation="A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}" />

Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
- r is the annual interest rate.
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time in years.

Compound interest is really hard to grasp as a human because we experience time linearly and so it's hard to think 
of something like exponential growth when it comes to money and how it compounds when reinvested. Another reason
why this is hard to implement is that it takes consistency and patience to see the results of compound interest.

The interesting thing about this principle is that it applies not only to finance but also to expertise, knowledge, and habits.
James Clear talks about this in his book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) sharing that self-improvement
can compound similarly to that of finance. Specifically, he shares that if you can get 1% better each day, over time you can see a 
37% improvement.

I personally find it a hopeful message that plateaus can be surpassed when my attention focuses on small improvements over time usually through deliberate practice.
The problem I have with the above image is that I don't really know what **better** means. It has been a while since I have read the book
and I assume that Clear explains it but for now I find specific examples in my own life insightful. 

Also, aside from giving a brief explanation of the principle and making a connection that Clear has already made, 
I am writing this post to point out that the principle can be applied to even more granular skills and habits. 
The two topics that I want to write about specifically is productivity and longevity.

## Productivity
As anyone who has browsed the self-help section of a library can confirm, productivity is one of the most prevalent topics.
In my first few years in my 20s, I read so many of these books and really got sick of the endless amount of anecdotes given and
generic surface-level advice. Every once and a while, I would find a gem and that would improve my approach 
to prioritizing, planning, and executing. Some of these sources include:

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) in 2019
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) in 2020 (which was later replaced by [raycast](https://raycast.com/) )
- Tim Ferriss' [Podcast](https://tim.blog) in 2020
- [How to Take Smart Notes](https://a.co/d/22UUnUb) by SÃ¶nke Ahrens in 2021
- [4000 Weeks](https://a.co/d/6q74SqL) by Oliver Burkeman in 2023

Again, I couldn't fully pinpoint the point in which I felt that my productivity improved from its baseline but I can say 
that the ability to formulate what is important to me and then being able to actually make it happen opens so many doors
for my life.

## Longevity
I define longevity as the goal of increasing both healthspan and lifespan. Healthspan is the number of years in good health and 
lifespan is the number of years you live. The reason I use the term longevity as opposed to health is because I find the accompanying
terminology to help me understand the complex topic better.

I originally started thinking about this topic in 2021, when I was curious how I could improve my exercise routine aside from
the current calisthenics I was doing. I found out about Peter Attia via the Tim Ferriss podcast and was intrigued by his multifaceted approach.

Via Peter Attia and others, I slowly began to realize that there were so many things that I had not considered that improve my life like
sleep, nutrition, proper footwear, proper skincare, etc. Similar to productivity, each facet complements the other. Good sleep boosted my recovery,
which helped me exercise more, which helped me want to eat better, and the cycle goes on and on like that.

## Is it really exponential though?

The gains I saw in producity and longevity were incredibly helpful but were the gains exponential?
Below is a chart that I asked Claude to make to describe the general phenomenon of a someone becoming an expert in a field.

Clearly, the line isn't exponential as it is barely not a plateau. So then why would I bring up compound growth in the first place?

Well, I believe the chart is missing an important aspect of growth which is the idea of leaps. 

These leaps occur when we make connections between different areas of knowledge or when we have sudden breakthroughs in understanding. While our overall progress might not be strictly exponential, these leaps can lead to significant jumps in overall capabilities and knowledge.

For example, because I have spent a lot of time improving my lifeOS in Notion, my ability to organize information has improved which has helped me to experiment with and track new experiments in longevity. Because I have increase the rate at which I improve my health, I am also more productive with higher levels of energy. 

These interconnected improvements create a network effect of growth. Each small gain in one area can positively influence others, leading to compound benefits over time. While we may not reach truly exponential levels of growth, the compounding effect of these interconnected improvements can still lead to significant, long-term progress that far exceeds linear growth.

In conclusion, while the path to expertise or improvement in any area may not be a smooth exponential curve, the principle of compound growth still applies. By focusing on consistent small improvements and remaining open to those moments of leap-like progress, we can harness the power of compounding in various aspects of our lives, from productivity and longevity to knowledge and skills.
