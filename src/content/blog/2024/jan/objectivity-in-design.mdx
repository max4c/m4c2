I started building this website with various influences like [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/), [Nat Friedman](https://nat.org/), and many other serious entrepreneurs that opt for a barebones, no nonsense approach, to their websites.

Then I read Paul Graham's essay [Taste for Makers](https://paulgraham.com/taste.html). I appreciated it so much because based on my liberal arts background, I have made a conscious decision that all things can contain *verum, bonum,* and *pulchrum* (truth, goodness, and beauty).

There are inherent laws that exist in design based on proportion, symmetry, and form. Now, as someone that believes in objectivity, I do want to shy away from the complexity of the universe that I first encountered when learning about geometry.

I studied Euclid in high school and it was quite satisfying to see clear, logical postulates provide clear, logical proofs about the universe created by those postulates. But with the advances in theoretical physics and non-Euclidean geometry, that universe created in a box falls apart due to question marks and complexity.

I compare design to geometry to acknowledge that reality is far more complex and nuanced than initially conceived. This acceptance does not, however, negate the principles of design or mathematics but rather invites the expert to dive deeper into the waters of complexity and find the pearls of truth.
