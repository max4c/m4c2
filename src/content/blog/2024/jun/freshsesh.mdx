A developer tool that uses a local LLM to provide personalized context summaries of your previous work sessions.

Coming back to a project after time away is disorienting. FreshSesh solves this by automatically generating summaries of where you left off, what you were thinking, and what needs to happen next—all running locally on your machine.
