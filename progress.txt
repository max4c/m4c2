   - Keep this secure and never commit to version control

2. `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID`: The ID of your "The Signal" audience in Resend
   - Found in the Resend dashboard under Audiences
   - This is where new subscribers will be added

3. `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`: The sender email address (signal@maxforsey.com)
   - Must be verified in your Resend account
   - Used as the "from" address for all emails

### Local Development Setup ✅
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_WE83wCbm_xqpZqzFybdxSUb2s1VwUMNBy
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=a8323d9b-d9aa-4af8-a0d3-6d629a8d17d4
