# PRD Generator Prompt

Transform my idea/concept below into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for [PROJECT_NAME]. The PRD should provide clear direction for both product vision and technical implementation.

Please create a structured PRD with the following sections:

## Project Overview
- Provide a concise summary of the project/feature
- Explain the problem it solves and why it's valuable
- Define the scope of the project

## Goals & Objectives
- List 3-5 specific, measurable goals for this project
- Define what success looks like
- Identify key metrics that will be used to measure success

## Target Audience
- Describe the primary users/customers for this project
- Explain their needs, pain points, and how this addresses them
- Include any relevant user personas

## Feature Requirements
[Break down the project into clear, specific features/components]

**Feature 1: [Name]**
- Detailed description of functionality
- User flows and interactions
- Edge cases and considerations

**Feature 2: [Name]**
- Detailed description of functionality
- User flows and interactions
- Edge cases and considerations

[Add more features as needed]

## User Experience Requirements
- Describe the overall user experience and journey
- Define key user interactions and flows
- Outline any specific UX considerations or constraints
- List accessibility requirements

## Technical Requirements
- Define the technical approach and architecture
- List required technologies, APIs, or integrations
- Outline any specific performance requirements
- Note any technical constraints or considerations

## Design Specifications
- Describe the visual design direction and requirements
- List any brand guidelines or design constraints
- Specify required design assets or components
- Note any responsive design considerations

## Implementation Considerations
- Outline any dependencies or prerequisites
- Note any security, privacy, or compliance requirements
- Identify potential technical challenges
- List any third-party services or tools required

## Out of Scope
- Clearly define what is NOT included in this project
- List any features or considerations for future phases

## Timeline & Milestones
- Provide a high-level implementation timeline
- Define key milestones or phases
- Note any critical deadlines

Format the PRD in a clear, well-structured manner using markdown for readability. Ensure that the requirements are specific enough to guide implementation but not so prescriptive that they limit creative solutions.
